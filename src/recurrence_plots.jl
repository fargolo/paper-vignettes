double_inference_weighted(rec_matrix::RecurrenceMatrix;seqs="double",max_window=6)

Returns set of probabilities associated with consecutive runs in off-diagonals.

Argument `seqs` sets the type of consecutive sequences.  
Could be either 'double' (recurrences and non-recurrences), 'recurrences' or 'poincare' (non-recurrences).  
The first n diagonals (given by `max_window` argument) are considered.
See `AnalyticComb.p_val_weighted` and  `AnalyticComb.weighted_bin_runs_coeff`.
