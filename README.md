# SymbolicInference.jl
Probability-based inferences based on the symbolic method.  

Run the `test.jl` file to obtain current results.  

The `double_inference` function uses the solution for the consecutive runs problem (Flaj. & Sedgewick, page 52.).  

The initial implementation checks sequences in recurrence matrices columnwise.
