# SymbolicInference.jl
Probability-based inferences based on the symbolic method.  

I'm currently working on the "Révéz test" (placeholder name). 

The `double_inference` function uses the solution for the consecutive runs problem (Flaj. & Sedgewick, page 52.   and R ÉV ÉSZ , P. Strong theorems on coin tossing. In Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians (Helsinki, 1978) (Helsinki, 1980), Acad. Sci. Fennica, pp. 749–754.)  

Run the `test_paral.jl` file to obtain current results.
